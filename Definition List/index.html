            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the
            presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
            or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).

            JavaScript
            <dd>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology
                of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use
                JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
                Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
                These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
                The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
